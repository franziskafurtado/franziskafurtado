Welcome to my github profile!


I'm Franziska Furtado, a developer curently working with Front End Web Development (mostly AngularJS) and SQL solution (PostgreSQL).

Hopefully I will be a computer engineer by the end of next year.

I know a little of many languagens since graduation required me to, some of then are: assembly, C, C++, java and javascript.

I'm always learning and my favorite interest areas are low-level programming, embedded systems, digital electronics and database automated searchs.

I have always been a lover of computers and learning new things.

Outside of world of tech I love music, working out and I've been trying to learn how to roller skate.
