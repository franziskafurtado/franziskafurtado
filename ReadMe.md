Welcome to my github profile!


I'm Franziska Furtado, a developer currently working with Front End Web Development (mostly AngularJS) and SQL (PostgreSQL). :desktop_computer:

Hopefully I will be a computer engineer by the end of next year. 

I'm always learning and my favorite interest areas are low-level programming, embedded systems, digital electronics and database automated searches.

I love computers and learning new things. :books:

:two_hearts: Outside of world of tech I love music, working out and I've been trying to learn how to roller skate.
